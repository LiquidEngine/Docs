# Mesh

Mesh components reference a mesh that is associated with an entity. You can drag any mesh from your asset browser to the entity to add or update mesh of an entity. Note that, adding a mesh component does not render the mesh in the scene. For that, you need the mesh renderer component.

The component in the inspector shows the reference to the component and the number of geometries the component has.
